  "body": " Authors' Introduction   This Manual describes the C System Chromatic Button Accordion with both Stradella and Free Bass.  The intention is to present information and guidance, where applicable to the accordion, that has influenced me during many years of playing finger-style guitar.  I was particularly drawn to the button accordion (rather than the piano accordion); noting that Chord and Scale construction on this type of keyboard allow the use of consistent shapes, specific to different Chord and Scale Types, that may be moved anywhere on the keyboard giving a chord identified by the Tonic in that shape.  I think there is considerable benefit to the accordion player in considering the \"piano grip systems\" used by jazz pianists and will also include a summary of Mick Goodricks' Voice Leading Almanack's which hold a vast ammount of harmonic information, providing an opportunity for the accordion player to enjoy assimilating the feel of these progressions for themselves. The Almanacks were collated by a jazz guitar player and educator, but they are enormously useful to all players of polyphonic instruments.  This use of fingering shapes is similar to the way in which different Chords and Scales are represented in many resources used by Guitar Players, removing the need to read music whilst still being able to learn about Scale and Chord construction and gaining access to the many Chord Progressions. A relatively small number of shapes cover all Scale Chord Types in all inversions.   "

  "body": " Intervals  Before discussing scales it is useful to understand how intervals between notes are described.  The musical distance between notes on your instrument keyboard or on a musical staff is known as an interval. This interval might be described as a minor 2nd, a major 2nd, a minor 3rd, a major 3rd, a 5th, a 7th etc;  The interval between two notes can be obtained by counting the number of semi-tones on the keyboard or staff but, when counting intervals, the first note, should be counted as one and not zero.

Using intervals alone it is possible to build the different scales and chords. Knowledge of intervals can also be very useful in sight reading and I hope to include some examples of this later in the manual.     2nd Interval Shapes     xml:id=\"sub-sec-3rd-intervals\" xmlns:xi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XInclude\" 3rd-interval-shapes   These shapes can be moved to any position on the keyboard and show the relative position of keyboard buttons for the different intervals.
