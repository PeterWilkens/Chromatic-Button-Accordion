  "body": " Authors' Introduction   This Manual describes the C System Chromatic Button Accordion with both Stradella and Free Bass.  The intention is to present information and guidance, where applicable to the accordion, that has influenced me during many years of playing finger-style guitar.  I was particularly drawn to the button accordion (rather than the piano accordion); noting that Chord and Scale construction on this type of keyboard allow the use of consistent shapes specific to different Chord and Scale Types.  That shape may be moved anywhere on the keyboard giving a chord identified by the Tonic in that shape.  I think there is considerable benefit to the accordion player in considering the \"piano grip systems\" used by jazz pianists and will also include a summary of Mick Goodricks' Voice Leading Almanack's which hold a vast ammount of harmonic information, providing an opportunity for the accordion player to enjoy assimilating the feel of these progressions for themselves. The Almanacks were collated by a jazz guitar player and educator, but they are enormously useful to all players of polyphonic instruments.  This use of fingering shapes is similar to the way in which different Chords and Scales are represented in many resources used by Guitar Players, removing the need to read music whilst still being able to learn about Scale and Chord construction and gaining access to the many Chord Progressions. A relatively small number of shapes cover all Scale Chord Types in all inversions.   "

  "title": "The Chromatic Button Accordion",
  "body": " The Chromatic Button Accordion   This type of accordion is characterised by the Buttons on the Right hand (Treble Side). The Treble buttons are arranged chromatically in a number of columns. In the accordion I am considering in this manual, there are 5 columns, but the last two, nearest the bellows, duplicate notes already found in the first three rows. The additional rows allow more options in fingering. There are some smaller accordions that have only the first three rows without duplication. Figure 2.0.2 shows a detailed arrangement of the keys on the treble side.  In the most common type of chromatic accordion, with a Stradella bass, the bass and chord buttons are arranged in six columns parallel to the bellows. The columns are: Counter Bass, Bass, Maj Chord, Minor Chord, 7th Chord and Diminished Chord. The basses are arranged in intervals of a fifth and the chords follow the second row of basses. See Figure 2.0.3 for detailed arrangement of the keys on a Stradella Bass instrument.  In the Free Bass accordion the outer-most 4 columns are arranged chromatically. In the C System the left hand keyboard mirrors the treble keys allowing much more freedom of chord choice and construction than on a Stradella bass allbeit at the expenditure of more mental effort by the player. See Figure 2.0.4 of the Free-Bass layout.    High quality Italian Chromatic Button Accordion with Stradella and Free Bass.

  "body": " Intervals  Before discussing scales it is useful to understand how intervals between notes are described.  The musical distance between notes on your instrument keyboard or on a musical staff is known as an interval. This interval might be described as a minor 2nd, a major 2nd, a minor 3rd, a major 3rd, a 5th, a 7th etc;  The interval between two notes can be obtained by counting the number of semi-tones on the keyboard or staff but, when counting intervals, the first note, should be counted as one and not zero.

Using intervals alone it is possible to build the different scales and chords. Knowledge of intervals can also be very useful in sight reading.     2nd Interval Shapes     xml:id=\"sub-sec-3rd-intervals\" xmlns:xi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XInclude\" 3rd-interval-shapes   These shapes can be moved to any position on the keyboard and show the relative position of keyboard buttons for the different intervals.

  "body": " Scales  All Major Scales have a sequence of whole tone, whole tone, half tone, whole tone,whole tone, half tone between the tonic notes.  An alternative method of generating any major scale would be to count through the Chromatic Scale note to note. Using C Major again as an example, using the following count from the C Tonic note 1 3 5 6 8 10 and 12 will provide the notes of any Major Scale.  Similarly all other scales can be generated using the count specific to that type of scale.  See Section 3.3 on Scale Construction for details of other scales and how they are made up.

Once you know the \"shape\" of a particular scale or chord on the keyboard, that shape can be moved elsewhere on the keyboard and provide chords and scales in all the other Keys.  In other words shapes can be moved to any position on the keyboard and maintain the relative position of keyboard buttons for specific Scale and Chord types.

  "body": "- Scale Construction  Arranging the chromatic scale in a a cicular fashion can be useful in the construction of both chords and scales.  Take for example the scale of C Major. Looking at the interval pattern for a Major Scale we see it is given by a Major 2nd, a Major 2nd, a minor 2nd, a Major 2nd, a Major 2nd, a Major 2nd, a minor 2nd back to the Tonic. Using these intervals and starting on the Tonic C gives a scale of:  C,D,E,F,G,A,B back to C.  This is the scale of C Major (A scale with no sharp or flat notes i.e all white notes.)  The same approach can be applied to any tonic on the wheel and using the same interval structure will give the notes of that Tonics' Major Scale.  eg; Taking D as the Tonic would give: D, E, F sharp, G, A, B, and C sharp which is the Scale of D Major.      12 tone chromatic scale    "

  "body": " Chord Construction  Chords are generated from different scales and are then said to be diatonic to that particular scale, which means crudely that they are part of, and in tune with, that scale. The Chord and Scale Wheel is used to first generate the scale from which the chord will be derived and the scales' diatonic chords are then generated from that scale.   Chord and Scale Wheel    Chords in C Major Take for example the scale of C Major. We know from the Scale Construction Chapter that the scale of C Major is C D E F G A B C  A C Major Triad is easily built from the scale. The first note ( the Root) is given by the Tonic note of the scale. The next note of the triad is a Major 3rd above the Tonic (count 3 from C including the start and finish note) giving E, the final note of the Triad is a Minor 3rd above E which is G. ie; the C Major Triad in root position is C E G.  Another way of looking at this is to use alternate notes of the Scale: Starting at the first note of the Scale, C, miss the next note, go to E, miss the next note, go to G. Gives C E G.
