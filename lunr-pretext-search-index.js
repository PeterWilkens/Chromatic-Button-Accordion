  "body": " Introduction   This Manual describes the C System Chromatic Button Accordion with both Stradella and Free Bass.  The manual will focus primarily on chord and scale construction on both treble and free bass keyboards.  I was drawn to the button accordion, rather than the piano accordion, noting that Chord and Scale construction on this type of keyboard allow the use of moveable shapes specific to different Chord and Scale Types. Each shape may be moved anywhere on the keyboard giving a chord or scale identified by the Tonic in the shape.  This use of keyboard shapes is similar to the way in which different Chords and Scales are represented in many resources used by Guitar Players; removing the need to read music whilst still being able to learn about Scale and Chord construction.  The shapes shown for the treble keyboard are mirrored on the free-bass keyboard so it is easy to generate the chord shapes for the bass once you have grasped how the the treble side works.  As a matter of interest, on the button accordion, chord shapes are consistent across the keyboard, unlike on the guitar where the interval between strings alters between the third and second string which necessitates some alteration of chord shapes in that area of the fingerboard.  The main scales and chord types (in various inversions) will be considered. . The Manual is written for accordions using a C System keyboard, but the B System layout is summarised in an Appendix.   "

  "title": "The Chromatic Button Accordion",
  "body": " The Chromatic Button Accordion   This type of accordion is characterised by the Buttons on the Right hand (Treble Side). The Treble buttons are arranged chromatically in a number of columns. In the accordion I am considering in this manual, there are 5 columns, but the last two, nearest the bellows, duplicate notes already found in the first three columns. The additional columns allow more options in fingering. There are some smaller accordions that have only the first three columns without duplication. Figure 2.0.2 shows a detailed arrangement of the keys on the treble side.  In the most common type of chromatic accordion, with a Stradella bass, the bass and chord buttons are arranged in six columns parallel to the bellows. The columns are: Counter Bass, Bass, Major Chord, Minor Chord, 7th Chord and Diminished Chord. The basses are arranged in intervals of a fifth and the chords follow the second row of basses. See Figure 2.0.3 for detailed arrangement of the keys on a Stradella Bass instrument.  In the Free Bass accordion the outer-most 4 columns are arranged chromatically. In the C System the left hand keyboard mirrors the treble keys allowing much more freedom of chord choice and construction than on a Stradella bass allbeit at the expenditure, initially, of more mental effort by the player. See Figure 2.0.4 of the Free-Bass layout.    High quality Italian Chromatic Button Accordion with Stradella and Free Bass.

  "title": "Intervals",
  "body": " Intervals   Before discussing scales it is useful to understand how intervals between notes are described.  The musical distance between notes on your instrument keyboard or on a musical staff is known as an interval. This interval is dependant on the number of semitones between notes and is described as a minor 2nd, a major 2nd, a minor 3rd, a major 3rd, a 5th, a 7th etc;  The interval between two notes can be obtained by counting between notes on the keyboard or staff but, when counting, the first note, should be counted as one and not zero. Using this type of count the actual number of intervals is 1 less than the count.    Example above shows two notes, an F and a C, on a staff with a treble clef. Counting the notes F to C: count F as one, F to F as two, F > to G as three, G to G as four, G to A as five, A to B as six, B to B as seven, and B to C as eight. F and C are even semitones or five whole notes apart which indicates that the interval between these two notes is a fifth   Interval Count    Interval Type  Semitones between notes  Count    Minor 2nd  1 Semitone  2    Major 2nd  2 Semitones  3    Minor 3rd  3 Semitones  4    Major 3rd  4 Semitones  5    Perfect 4th  5 Semitones  6    5  6 Semitones  7    5th  7 Semitones  8    Augmented 5th  8 Semitones  9    6th  9 Semitones  10    Diminished 7th  9 Semitones  10    Minor 7th  10 Semitones  11    Major 7th  11 Semitones  12     xml:id=\"sub-sec-intervals\" xmlns:xi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XInclude\" 2nd-interval-shapes   It is important to realise that the various shapes can be moved to any position on the keyboard and will maintain the same relationshio between notes in the shape.The shapes show the relative position of keyboard buttons for the different intervals.  Using intervals alone it is possible to build the different scales and chords. Knowledge of intervals can also be very useful in sight reading.     2nd Interval Shapes     xml:id=\"sub-sec-3rd-intervals\" xmlns:xi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XInclude\" 3rd-interval-shapes   These shapes can be moved to any position on the keyboard and show the relative position of keyboard buttons for the different intervals.  Using intervals alone it is possible to build the different scales and chords. Knowledge of intervals can also be very useful in sight reading and I hope to include some examples of this later in the manual.     2nd Interval Shapes     "

Using C Major again as an example, using the following count from the C Tonic note 1 3 5 6 8 10 and 12 will provide the notes of any Major Scale.  Similarly all other scales can be generated using the count specific to that type of scale.  See Section 3.3 on Scale Construction for details of other scales and how they are made up.

  "title": "Scale Construction",
  "body": "- Scale Construction  Arranging the chromatic scale in a a circular fashion can be useful in the construction of both chords and scales.  Take for example the scale of C Major. Looking at the interval pattern for a Major Scale we see it is given by a Major 2nd, a Major 2nd, a minor 2nd, a Major 2nd, a Major 2nd, a Major 2nd, a minor 2nd back to the Tonic. Using these intervals and starting on the Tonic C gives a scale of:  C,D,E,F,G,A,B back to C.  This is the scale of C Major (A scale with no sharp or flat notes i.e all white notes.)  The same approach can be applied to any tonic on the wheel and using the same interval structure will give the notes of that Tonics' Major Scale.  eg;) Taking D as the Tonic would give: D, E, F , G, A, B, and C which is the Scale of D Major.    12 tone chromatic scale    The following tables show the intervals between notes in different scale types.   Major Scale    Scale Degree  Tones between notes  Type of Interval     Tonic to Note 2  Whole Tone  Major 2nd    Note 2 to Note 3  Whole Tone  Major 2nd    Note 3 to Note 4  Half Tone  Minor 2nd    Note 4 to Note 5  Whole Tone  Major 2nd    Note 5 to Note 6  Whole Tone  Major 2nd    Note 6 to Note 7  Whole Tone  Major 2nd    Note 7 to Tonic  Half Tone  Minor 2nd     A natural minor scale\/key consists of the same notes as its relative major.  e.g;) The notes of the C major scale are C, D, E, F, G, A, and B.  A minor is the Relative Minor of C Major. The A Minor Natural Scale uses these same notes, the sixth note of the major scale becoming the root note of the relative minor.  eg; the notes of the A Minor Natural Scale are A, B, C, D, E, F, G and A.  The C Minor Natural notes are C, D, E , F, G, A , B and C.

To play a Harmonic Minor Scale, you simply raise the seventh note of the Natural Minor Scale by a half-step as you go up and down the scale  eg; the notes C Harmonic Minor are D, D, E ,F, G, A , B , C and C, B , A , G, F, E , D and C.\/    Scale Degree  Tones between notes  Type of Interval    Tonic to Note 2  Whole Tone  Major 2nd    Note 2 to Note 3  Half Tone  Minor 2nd    Note 3 to Note 4  Whole Tone  Major 2nd    Note 4 to Note 5  Whole Tone  Major 2nd    Note 5 to Note 6  Half Tone  Minor 2nd    Note 6 to Note 7  Whole and a half Tone  Augmented 2nd    Note 7 to Tonic  Half Tone  Minor 2nd     For the Melodic Minor Scale, you raise the sixth and seventh notes of the Harmonic Minor scale by a half step as you go up the scale returning to the Natural Minor as you go down the scale. e.g; The notes of the C melodic minor scale ascending are: C, D, E , F, G, A, B, C.

  "body": " Chord Construction  Chords are generated from different scales and are then said to be diatonic to that particular scale, which means crudely that they are part of, and in tune with, that scale. The Chord and Scale Wheel is used to first generate the scale from which the chord will be derived and the scales' diatonic chords are then generated from that scale.   Chord and Scale Wheel    Chords in C Major Take for example the scale of C Major. We know from the Scale Construction Chapter that the scale of C Major is C D E F G A B C  A C Major Triad is easily built from the scale. By using alternate notes of the Scale: Starting at the first note, C, missing the next note, going to E, missing the next note and going to G gives the C Major Triad C E G.  Continuing from G missing the next note and going to B gives The C Major 7th chord, C E G B  Examining the intervals between each note of the Triad: between C and E is a Major 3rd, Between E and G is a minor 3rd. Between G and B is a Major 3rd. Considering the intervals between the Root note C and the other notes: C to E as we have already seen is a Major 3rd, C to G is a 5th, C to B is a Major 7th.  All Major 7th Chords in Root position have that interval structure.   Notes from C Maj Scale on wheel.   Building Chords on all degrees of the C Major scale gives the following collection of 7th Chords diatonic to the scale.

  "title": "Triads and their Inversions",
  "body": " Triads and their Inversions  Intervals of a Third are at the core of chord construction and Triads are made by stacking the third and fifth note of a scale on top of the Root note. In the C Major Scale, the third interval above C is E and the third interval above E is G. The C Major Triad is thus CEG.  It should also be noted that a Major Triad consists of a Minor Third stacked on top of a Major Third when in the Root position ie; in the case of C Major the Minor Third E to G is stacked on top of the Major Third C to E.  A C Minor Triad is produced in the same fashion by stacking the Third of the C Minor Scale on top of the Root with the Fifth stacked on top of the third, but in the case of the C Minor scale the Third is E and not E, thus the Minor Triad becomes C-E -G demonstrating that a Minor Triad consists of a Major Third Stacked on top of a Minor Third when in the Root Position.  All Triads can be played as Inversions when the order of the notes are changed. eg; 1st Inversion: 3rd, 5th, Root and 2nd Inversion Fifth, Root and 3rd.  The other main Triads are: The Diminished Triad and The Augmented Triad. They are combinations of dissimilar thirds. ie; the Diminished Triad is constructed from a minor third built onto a minor third and an Augmented Triad is constructed from a major third built onto a major third. the shape of each Chord.

In the case of a Major triad adding a Major 7th produces a Major seventh chord, but adding a minor seventh produces a Dominant Seventh chord.    7th Chord Shape Diagrams    Table 4.2.2. below shows how adding different 7th notes to a Triad changes the Chord.

The chords are of different inversions and are chosen to provide a smooth transition, one chord to the next (voice leading). All of the chords are known as drop 2 chords where the note that would normally be second from the top is dropped to the bass position. This new bottom note is not necessarily the Root note of that particular chord.  You may also notice that the progression is effectively made up of a series of 2-5-1 chords. Playing through this progression is useful in demonstrating smooth voice leading and introduces a range of different chords which are all transferable to other positions on the keyboard, the same shape producing a different chord.

  "body": " Chord Melody   The following method provides a useful way for beginners to start learning to play chord melodies using both hands. This exercise will enhance familiarity with the keyboards and provide ear training.  Using the basic Chords from a Fake Book or Lead Sheet, the left hand plays the Root and Fifth of the Chord, The right hand plays the appropriate 3rd and 7th and the melody note of the tune.  If the notated chords include the more complex constructions eg, 13ths, 11ths, 9ths etc; the added notes can be ignored and the basic Major, Minor and 7th chords used. If a 6th chord is called for then the 6th is used instead of the 7th.  As the ear develops then the more complex chords can be introduced.   The following exercise is designed to enable the beginner to gain familiarity with the various shapes playing a series of ii V I progressions in all keys.  Following the Circle of 5ths provides an ideal means of playing through all keys.   ii V I Practice to facilitate the above approach to chord melody construction    ii  ii  V7  V7  IMaj7  IMaj7    R Hand  R Hand  R Hand  R Hand  R Hand  R Hand    7th  3rd  7th  3rd  7th  3rd    3rd  7th  3rd  7th  3rd  7th    L Hand   L Hand   L Hand     5th   5th   5th     Root   Root   Root       Chord Melody Specific Example Dmi7\/G7\/CMaj7    > Dmi7  Dmi7  G7  G7  C Maj7  CMaj    R Hand  R Hand  R Hand  R Hand  R Hand  R Hand    C  F  F  B  B  E    F  C  B  F  E  B    L Hand   L Hand   L Hand     A   D   G     D   G   C      "
