  "body": " Introduction   This Manual describes the C System Chromatic Button Accordion with both Stradella and Free Bass.  The manual will focus primarily on chord and scale construction on both treble and free bass keyboards.  I was drawn to the button accordion, rather than the piano accordion, noting that Chord and Scale construction on this type of keyboard allow the use of moveable shapes specific to different Chord and Scale Types. Each shape may be moved anywhere on the keyboard giving a chord or scale identified by the Tonic in the shape.  This use of keyboard shapes is similar to the way in which different Chords and Scales are represented in many resources used by Guitar Players; removing the need to read music whilst still being able to learn about Scale and Chord construction.  The shapes shown for the treble keyboard are mirrored on the free-bass keyboard so it is easy to generate the chord shapes for the bass once you have grasped how the the treble side works.  As a matter of interest, on the button accordion, chord shapes are consistent across the keyboard, unlike on the guitar where the interval between strings alters between the third and second string which necessitates some alteration of chord shapes in that area of the fingerboard.  The main scales and chord types (in various inversions) will be considered. . The Manual is written for accordions using a C System keyboard, but the B System layout is summarised in an Appendix.   "

  "title": "The Chromatic Button Accordion",
  "body": " The Chromatic Button Accordion   This type of accordion is characterised by the Buttons on the Right hand (Treble Side). The Treble buttons are arranged chromatically in a number of columns. In the accordion I am considering in this manual, there are 5 columns, but the last two, nearest the bellows, duplicate notes already found in the first three rows. The additional rows allow more options in fingering. There are some smaller accordions that have only the first three rows without duplication. Figure 2.0.2 shows a detailed arrangement of the keys on the treble side.  In the most common type of chromatic accordion, with a Stradella bass, the bass and chord buttons are arranged in six columns parallel to the bellows. The columns are: Counter Bass, Bass, Major Chord, Minor Chord, 7th Chord and Diminished Chord. The basses are arranged in intervals of a fifth and the chords follow the second row of basses. See Figure 2.0.3 for detailed arrangement of the keys on a Stradella Bass instrument.  In the Free Bass accordion the outer-most 4 columns are arranged chromatically. In the C System the left hand keyboard mirrors the treble keys allowing much more freedom of chord choice and construction than on a Stradella bass allbeit at the expenditure, initially, of more mental effort by the player. See Figure 2.0.4 of the Free-Bass layout.    High quality Italian Chromatic Button Accordion with Stradella and Free Bass.

The musical distance between notes on your instrument keyboard or on a musical staff is known as an interval. This interval might be described as a minor 2nd, a major 2nd, a minor 3rd, a major 3rd, a 5th, a 7th etc;  The interval between two notes can be obtained by counting the number of semi-tones on the keyboard or staff but, when counting intervals, the first note, should be counted as one and not zero.

An alternative method of generating any major scale would be to count through the Chromatic Scale note to note. Using C Major again as an example, using the following count from the C Tonic note 1 3 5 6 8 10 and 12 will provide the notes of any Major Scale.  Similarly all other scales can be generated using the count specific to that type of scale.  See Section 3.3 on Scale Construction for details of other scales and how they are made up.

Once you know the \"shape\" of a particular scale or chord on the keyboard, that shape can be moved elsewhere on the keyboard and provide chords and scales in all the other Keys.  In other words shapes can be moved to any position on the keyboard and maintain the relative position of keyboard buttons for specific Scale and Chord types.

  "body": "- Scale Construction  Arranging the chromatic scale in a a cicular fashion can be useful in the construction of both chords and scales.  Take for example the scale of C Major. Looking at the interval pattern for a Major Scale we see it is given by a Major 2nd, a Major 2nd, a minor 2nd, a Major 2nd, a Major 2nd, a Major 2nd, a minor 2nd back to the Tonic. Using these intervals and starting on the Tonic C gives a scale of:  C,D,E,F,G,A,B back to C.  This is the scale of C Major (A scale with no sharp or flat notes i.e all white notes.)  The same approach can be applied to any tonic on the wheel and using the same interval structure will give the notes of that Tonics' Major Scale.  eg; Taking D as the Tonic would give: D, E, F , G, A, B, and C which is the Scale of D Major.      12 tone chromatic scale    The following scores show the intervals between notes in different scale types.

  "body": " Chord Construction  Chords are generated from different scales and are then said to be diatonic to that particular scale, which means crudely that they are part of, and in tune with, that scale. The Chord and Scale Wheel is used to first generate the scale from which the chord will be derived and the scales' diatonic chords are then generated from that scale.   Chord and Scale Wheel    Chords in C Major Take for example the scale of C Major. We know from the Scale Construction Chapter that the scale of C Major is C D E F G A B C  A C Major Triad is easily built from the scale. By using alternate notes of the Scale: Starting at the first note, C, missing the next note, going to E, missing the next note and going to G gives the C Major Triad C E G.  Continuing from G missing the next note and going to B gives The C Major 7th chord, C E G B  Examining the intervals between each note of the Triad: between C and E is a Major 3rd, Between E and G is a minor 3rd. Between G and B is a Major 3rd. Considering the intervals between the Root note C and the other notes: C to E as we have already seen is a Major 3rd, C to G is a 5th, C to B is a Major 7th.  All Major 7th Chords in Root position have that interval structure.   Notes from C Maj Scale on wheel.

  "body": " Triads and their Inversions  Intervals of a Third are at the core of chord construction and Triads are made by stacking the third and fifth note of a scale on top of the Root note. In the C Major Scale, the third interval above C is E and the third interval above E is G. The C Major Triad is thus CEG.  It should also be noted that a Major Triad consists of a Minor Third stacked on top of a Major Third when in the Root position ie; in the case of C Major the Minor Third E to G is stacked on top of the Major Third C to E.  A C Minor Triad is produced in the same fashion by stacking the Third of the C Minor Scale on top of the Root with the Fifth stacked on top of the third, but in the case of the C Minor scale the Third is E and not E, thus the Minor Triad becomes C-E -G demonstrating that a Minor Triad consists of a Major Third Stacked on top of a Minor Third when in the Root Position.  All Triads can be played as Inversions when the order of the notes are changed. eg; 1st Inversion: 3rd, 5th, Root and 2nd Inversion Fifth, Root and 3rd.  The other main Triads are: The Diminished Triad and The Augmented Triad. They are combinations of dissimilar thirds. ie; the Diminished Triad is constructed from a minor third built onto a minor third and an Augmented Triad is constructed from a major third built onto a major third. Diagram 6.1.2 above shows the shape of each Chord. The Tonic note 1 gives the identity ie; if note 1 is D the Triad is a D Chord. Minor, Diminished or Augmented dependant on shape      "

The Diminished 7th Chord is interesting as any of its 4 constituent notes can be the Tonic, e.g in the Edim Chord shown above, the Chord can also be named as Gdim, A dim or C dim.  "

  "body": " Major ii-V-I with added note in Bass.  The following shows how adding an additional note in the bass changes the chord identity and type. The example shows a common progression that apears in many pieces of music of all types.  The chords shown are all in root position the additional note being added below the original Tonic note..    Diagrams of ii V I progressions      C Major Circle of 5 progression of Major 7ths     Circle of 5ths from the C Major Scale  This progression of chords all come from the scale of C major and follow each other a 4th interval apart. (The circle of fifths generates the same sequence of chords in the reverse order.) The chords are of different inversions and are chosen to provide a smooth transition, one chord to the next (voice leading). All of the chord are known as drop 2 chords where the note that would normally be second from the top is dropped to the bass position. This new bottom note is not necessarily the Root note of that particular chord. You may also notice that the progression is effectively made up of a series of 2-5-1 chords. Playing through this progression is useful in demonstrating smooth voice leading and introduces a range of different chords which are all transferable to other positions on the keyboard, the same shape producing a different chord.
