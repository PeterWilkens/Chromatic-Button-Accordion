  <title>Intervals</title>
 <introduction>
  <p>Before discussing scales it is useful to understand how intervals between notes are described.</p>
  <p>The musical distance between notes on  your instrument keyboard or on a musical staff is known as an interval. This interval is dependant on the number of semitones between notes and is described as a minor 2nd, a major 2nd, a minor 3rd, a major 3rd, a 5th, a 7th etc;</p>
  <p>The interval between two notes can be obtained by counting between notes on the keyboard or staff but, when counting, the first note, should be counted as one and not zero. Using this type of count the actual number of semitones
     is 1 less than the count.</p>

    <introduction>
    <p>It is important to realise that the various shapes can be moved to any position on the keyboard and will maintain the same relationshio between notes in the shape.The shapes show the relative position of keyboard buttons for the different intervals.</p>
    <p>Using intervals alone it is possible to build the different scales and chords. Knowledge of intervals can  also be very useful in sight reading.</p>

    <p>These shapes can be moved to any position on the keyboard and show the relative position of keyboard buttons for the different intervals.</p>
    <p>Using intervals alone it is possible to build the different scales and chords. Knowledge of intervals can  also be very useful in sight reading and I hope to include some examples of this later in the manual.</p>
