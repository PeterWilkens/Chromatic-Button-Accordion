  <title>Intervals</title>
 
  <p>Before discussing scales it is useful to understand how intervals between notes are described.</p>

  <p>The musical distance between notes on  your instrument keyboard or on a musical staff is known as an interval. This interval might be described as a minor 2nd, a major 2nd, a minor 3rd, a major 3rd, a 5th, a 7th etc;</p>
  <p>The interval between two notes can be obtained by counting the number of semi-tones on the keyboard or staff but, when counting intervals, the first note, should be counted as one and not zero.</p>

    <title>Interval Shapes</title>
    <introduction>
     
    <p>These shapes can be moved to any position on the keyboard and show the relative position of keyboard buttons for the different intervals.</p>
    <p>Using intervals alone it is possible to build the different scales and chords. Knowledge of intervals can  also be very useful in sight reading and I hope to include some examples of this later in the manual.</p>
