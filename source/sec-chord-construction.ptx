    <p> Chords are generated from different scales and are then said to be diatonic to that particular scale, which means crudely that they are part of, and in tune with, that scale. The Chord and Scale Wheel is used to first generate the scale from which the chord will be derived and the scales' diatonic chords are then generated from that scale. </p>

  <title>Chords in C Major</title>
  Take for example the scale of C Major. We know from the Scale Construction Chapter that the scale of C Major is C D E F G A B C 
</paragraphs>
<p>A C Major Triad is easily built from the scale. The first note ( the Root) is given by the Tonic note of the scale. The next note of the triad is a Major 3rd above the Tonic (count 3 from C including the start and finish note) giving E, the final note of the Triad is a Minor 3rd above E which is G. ie; the C Major Triad in root position is C E G.
 </p>
<p> Another way of looking at this is to use alternate notes of the Scale: Starting at the first note of the Scale, C, miss the next note, go to E, miss the next note, go to G. Gives C E G. </p>
