  <title>Chord Construction</title>
  
    <p> Chords are generated from different scales and are then said to be diatonic to that particular scale, which means crudely that they are part of, and in tune with, that scale. The Chord and Scale Wheel is used to first generate the scale from which the chord will be derived and the scales' diatonic chords are then generated from that scale. </p>

  <title>Chords in C Major</title>
  Take for example the scale of C Major. We know from the Scale Construction Chapter that the scale of C Major is C D E F G A B C 
</paragraphs>
<p>A C Major Triad is easily built from the scale. By using alternate notes of the Scale: Starting at the first note, C, missing the next note, going to E, missing the next note and going to G gives the C Major Triad C E G. </p>
<p> Continuing from G missing the next note and going to B gives The C Major 7th chord, C E G B</p>
<p>Examining the intervals between each note of the Triad: between C and E is a Major 3rd, Between E and G is a minor 3rd. Between G and B is a Major 3rd. Considering the intervals between the Root note C and the other notes: C to E as we have already seen is a Major 3rd, C to G is a 5th, C to B is a Major 7th.</p>
  <p> All Major 7th Chords in Root position have that interval structure. </p>

<p>Building Chords on all degrees of the C Major scale gives the following collection of Chords diatonic to the scale.</p>
