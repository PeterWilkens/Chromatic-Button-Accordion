    <p> Chords are generated from different scales and are then said to be diatonic to that particular scale, which means crudely that they are part of, and in tune with, that scale. The Chord and Scale Wheel is used to first generate the scale from which the chord will be derived and the scales' diatonic chords are then generated from that scale. </p>
