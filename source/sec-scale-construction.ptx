  <title>Scale Construction</title>
  <p>Arranging the chromatic scale in a a circular fashion can be useful in the construction of both chords and scales.</p>

<p>Take for example the scale of C Major. Looking at the interval pattern for a Major Scale we see it is given by a Major 2nd, a Major 2nd, a minor 2nd, a Major 2nd, a Major 2nd, a Major 2nd, a minor 2nd back to the Tonic. Using these intervals and starting on the Tonic C gives a scale of:</p> <p>C,D,E,F,G,A,B back to C.</p>
<p>This is the scale of C Major (A scale with no sharp  or flat notes i.e all white notes.)</p>
<p> The same approach can be applied to any tonic on the wheel and using the same interval structure will give the notes of that Tonics' Major Scale.</p>  
<p> eg;) Taking D  as the Tonic would give: D, E, F<sharp/>, G, A, B, and C<sharp/> which is the Scale of D  Major.</p>

<p>A Natural Minor Scale consists of the same notes as its relative major.</p> <p> e.g;) The notes of the C major scale are  C, D, E, F, G, A, and B. </p>
<p>The A Minor Natural scale is the Relative Minor of C Major. The A Minor Natural Scale uses these same notes, the sixth note of the major scale becoming the root note of the relative minor.</p>
<p>The notes of the A Minor Natural Scale are A, B, C, D, E, F, G and A.</p>
<p>The C Minor Natural notes are C, D, E<flat/>, F, G, A<flat/>, B<flat/> and C.</p>

  <title>Harmonic Minor Scale. To play a Harmonic Minor Scale, you simply raise the seventh note of the Natural Minor Scale by a half-step as you go up and down the scale</title>
<p>eg; the notes C Harmonic Minor are D, D, E<flat/>,F, G, A<flat/>, B<flat/>, C and C, B<flat/>, A<flat/>, G, F, E<flat/>, D and C./</p>

<p>For the Melodic Minor Scale, you raise the sixth and seventh notes of the Harmonic Minor scale by a half step as you go up the scale returning to the Natural Minor as you go down the scale.
  e.g; The notes of the C melodic minor scale ascending are: C, D, E<flat/>, F, G, A, B, C.
