  <title>Scale Construction Wheel</title>
  <p>Arranging the chromatic scale in a a cicular fashion can be useful in the construction of both chords and scales.</p>

<p>Take for example the scale of C Major. Looking at the interval pattern for a Major Scale we see it is given by a Major 2nd, a Major 2nd, a minor 2nd, a Major 2nd, a Major 2nd, a Major 2nd, a minor 2nd back to the Tonic. Using these intervals and staring on the Tonic C gives a scale of:</p> <p>C,D,E,F,G,A,B back to C.</p>
<p>This is the scale of C Major (A scale with no sharp  or flat notes i.e all white notes.)</p>
<p> The same approach can be applie to any tonic on the wheel and using the same interval structure will give the notes of that Tonics' Major Scale.</p>  
<p> eg; Taking D  as the Tonic would give: D, E, F sharp, G, A, B, and C sharp which is the Scale of D  Major.</p>
