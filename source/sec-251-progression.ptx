  <title>Major ii-V-I with added note in Bass. </title>
  <p>The following shows how adding an additional note in the bass changes the chord identity and type. The example shows a common progression that apears in many pieces of music of all types.</p>
  <p> The chords shown are all in root position the additional note being added below the original Tonic note..</p>
 <p> Incidentally, all but the bass note of the chords shown are on the treble keyboard. Additional notes on the bass side alter the chord. e.g; an F major chord played on treble side changes to a Dmi7 when a D note is added in Stradella or FreeBass keyboard. F A and C which is F Major becomes D F A C which is D minor7.</p>
