  <title>Major ii-V-I with added note in Bass. </title>
  <p>The following shows how adding an additional note in the bass (or treble) changes the chord identity and type. The example shows a common ii-V-I progression that apears in many pieces of music of all types.</p>
  <p> The chords shown are all in root position the additional note being added below the original Tonic note.</p>
 <p> Incidentally all but the bass note of the chords shown are on the treble keyboard. An additional note, this time, on the bass side alters the chord. e.g; an FMaj7 chord played on treble side changes to a Dmi7 when a D note is added on the Stradella or FreeBass keyboard. F A C and E which is FMaj7 becomes D F A C which is D minor7.</p>
