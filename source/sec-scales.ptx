    <p> All Major Scales have a sequence of whole tone, whole tone, half tone, whole tone,whole tone, half tone between the tonic notes.</p>
    
    <p> An alternative method of generating any major scale would be to count through the Chromatic Scale note to note. Using C Major again as an example, using the following count from the C Tonic note 1 3 5 6 8 10 and 12 will provide the notes of any Major Scale.</p>
    <p> Similarly all other scales can be generated using the count specific to that type of scale.</p>
    <p> See  Section 3.3 on Scale Construction for details of other scales and how they are made up.</p>

    <title>Scale Shapes</title>
  <introduction>
    <p> The Chromatic Button Accordion makes learning Scales and Chords relatively easy because the Keyboard is laid out in such a fashion that the physical relationship between notes remains constant. Once you know the "shape" of a particular scale or chord on the keyboard, that shape can be moved elsewhere on the keyboard and provide  chords and scales in all the other Keys.</p>
    <p>In other words shapes can be moved to any position on the keyboard and show the relative position of keyboard buttons for the different Scales.</p>
