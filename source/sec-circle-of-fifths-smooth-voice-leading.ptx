  <title>Progression of Drop 2 Diatonic Chords from C Major Scale. </title>
 <p>
    This progression of chords all come from the scale of C major and follow each other a 5th interval apart. </p><p>
    The chords are of different inversions and are chosen to provide a smooth transition, one chord to the next (voice leading).</p><p> All of the chords are known as drop 2 chords where the note that would normally be second from the top is dropped to the bass position. This new bottom note is not necessarily the Root note of that particular chord.</p>
    <p> You may also notice that the progression is effectively made up of a series of 2-5-1 chords.</p><p> Playing through this progression is useful in demonstrating smooth voice leading and introduces a range of different chords which are all transferable to other positions on the keyboard, the same shape producing a different chord. </p>
 <p>It is also worth noting that the progression is cycling through the <term>Circle of 5ths</term> which is discussed in detail in this manual. The Chords in this case are diatonic to the key of C Major.
