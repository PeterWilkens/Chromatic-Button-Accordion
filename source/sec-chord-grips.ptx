    <p><term>What is a Grip?</term></p>
<p>A grip is a seventh chord construction and will include either a major seventh, a minor
seventh, or a major sixth interval between the lowest and highest note. Grips are labeled
by the interval between their lowest and highest note and the chord quality will be determineded by the type of 7th and the type of  3rds  within the chord. It may have a Major, a Minor. a Diminished or an Augmented Tonality.</p>

 <p>With the exception of the diminished seventh grip, all grips are either major
or minor seventh grips.</p>
<p> A grip is primarily made up of four notes.</p>
<p>A single grip can be applied to many various types of chords by adding a different notes in the bass.</p>
    <p>By adding an additional note in the bass (or treble)  the chord identity and  quality is changed.</p>
   <p> Using these <term>grips</term> and understanding how the chord changes with different bass additions makes available a vast number of new chords all of which can be played with smooth voice leading.</p>
     <p>A number of exercises follow which should help with familiarisation and ear training.</p>
