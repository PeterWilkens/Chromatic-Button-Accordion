    <title>The Chromatic Button Accordion </title>
<introduction>

  <p>This type of accordion is characterised by the Buttons on the Right hand (Treble Side). The Treble buttons are arranged chromatically in a number of columns. In the accordion I am considering in this manual, there are 5 columns, but the last two, nearest the bellows, duplicate notes already found in the first three rows. The additional rows allow more options  in fingering. There are some smaller accordions that have only the first three rows without duplication. Figure 2.0.2 shows a detailed arrangement of the keys on the treble side.</p> 
   
    <p> In the most common type of chromatic accordion, with a Stradella bass, the bass and chord buttons are arranged in six columns parallel to the bellows. The columns are: Counter Bass, Bass, Maj Chord, Minor Chord, 7th Chord and Diminished Chord. The basses are arranged in intervals of a fifth  and the chords follow the second row of basses. See Diagram YYYYY showing detailed arrangement of the keys on a Stradella Bass instrument. </p>

    <p> In the Free Bass accordion the outer-most 4 columns are arranged chromatically. In the C System the left hand keyboard mirrors the treble keys allowing much more freedom of chord choice and construction than on a Stradella bass allbeit at the expenditure of more mental effort by the player. See Figure 2.0.3 of the Free-Bass layout.</p>
