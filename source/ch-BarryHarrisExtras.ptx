<p>The Barry Harris sixth diminished scale is a useful system for harmonizing major and minor scales. You’ll find it extremely useful and a great addition to your repertoire. The concept that it’s built on—resolving diminished chords—is very prevalent in both jazz and classical playing.</p>
<p> The scales are based on the amalgamation of 2 Chords in each scale as shown in the previous chapter (<xref ref="ch-dim6scale" text="type-global" />).</p>

  The Barry Harris sixth diminished scale is a system for attaching chords to each note of a major or minor scale. Here is the C major sixth diminished scale.

  There are a couple things to notice. The first is that going up the scale, you’re alternating between a diminished chord and a major chord, in this case C6 and Bo7. This is what gives the Barry Harris sixth diminished scale its characteristic sound.  Diminished chords are substitutes for dominant chords. Therein lies the essence of the Barry Harris sixth diminished scale. Let’s examine the Bo7 of the C major sixth diminished scale.
</p>

<p>
  Bo7 can be renamed as Abo7, which is a substitute chord for G7, which is the dominant chord of CMaj7. What we’re essentially doing is turning a scale into a I-V-I-V-I… progression. Each note/chord on the scale resolves into the next, and so forth.

The second thing to notice is that the notes of the scale aren’t the same as the notes of the traditional C major scale. 
We have an extra Ab in here. The reason for this is the I-V-I chord movement that defines the sixth diminished scale. If the scale were to just go from G to A, it would be going from C6 to C6.
</p>
<p>
  I-I is not compelling chord movement. By adding the Ab, we’re adding a note that is part of the Bo7 chord and will give us our nice sounding I-V-I chord movement.</p>

<p>Third thing is that we are using C6 chords instead of CMaj7. The reason is also related to the I-V-I chord movement. Think about what would happen if we were to use CMaj7 instead of C6. Try harmonizing the entire scale. You can’t. When you reach the Ab, you realize you can’t harmonize the A because it isn’t in the chord of CMaj7 or Bo7.
</p>
<p>
  However, there is an A in C6, hence why we use C6 instead of CMaj7 and why it’s called the sixth diminished scale instead of the seventh diminished scale. Notice that you don’t run into any trouble using CMaj7 instead of C6 for the lower parts of the scale, so this is definitely an option if you want to.

There is a small workaround if you’re intent on using CMaj7 for the entire scale. Remember that the essence of the Barry Harris sixth diminished scale is the I-V-I movement. You can preserve this by removing the Ab and adding a rootless G7 voicing of your choosing for the A. Now you preserve I-V-I chord movement everywhere in the scale except from B to C. Pretty good.

It’s not really the Barry Harris sixth diminished scale anymore, but it maintains the same harmonic spirit.
