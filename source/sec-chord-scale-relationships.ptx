  <title>Scales, Modes and Chords. </title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The following shows that Chords, Scales and Modes are actually one and the same collection of notes. Scales have the notes arranged in a horizontal linear fashion and are the notes you could use with the particular chord during improvisation. Chord notes from the scale (diatonic) are arranged vertically and are played simultaneously.  
    </p>
  </introduction>

  
   <p> A scale or mode is a subset of the 12 notes of an octave, and has two components:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>The notes they are comprised of;</li>
    <li>A tonal centre (or root note).</li>
    </ol>
 
  <p>The (diatonic) Major Scale has 7 notes, but scales can have fewer or more notes (all the way up to the Chromatic Scale with 12 notes).</p>
  <p>If you keep all the notes of a scale or mode the same but change the tonal centre, you create a new scale or mode. So, a mode is a scale created by establishing a new root note within a pre-existing scale. Modes are just a different way of thinking about scales and keys. Using modes allows us to allocate an individual mode/scale to every single chord in a progression.</p>
 <p>
Scales and chords are interrelated. A scale is a horizontal representation of a particular collection of notes and is built up in 2nds;   A chord is a vertical representation of that same collection of notes and is built in 3rds.</p>
<p>So, for example,
  If we take all the white notes and we go up in 2nds, then we have the C major scale (C D E F G A B); and if we take all the white notes again, but we go up in 3rds, then we have the CMaj13 (C E G B D F A) (ignore the fact that the ♮11 is not an available tension for the moment).
<p>Similarly,
  If we take all the white notes except for B♭ and we go up in 2nds, starting and finishing on the C (C D E F G A B♭), then we have C Mixolydian (or F major but starting and finishing on the C); and
  If we take those exact same notes and go up in 3rds, we have C13 (C E G B♭ D F A) (again, ignore the fact that the ♮11 is not an available tension for the moment).
Or again,
  If we take all the white notes except for the note F# and we go up in 2nds, starting and finishing on the C (C D E F# G A B), then we have C Lydian (or G major but starting and finishing on the C); and
  If we take those exact same notes and go up in 3rds, we have CMaj13#11 (C E G B D F# A). Right, so the
  C Major Scale has all the same notes as a CMaj13 chord;   C Mixolydian scale has all the same notes as a C13 chord;
  C Lydian Scale has all the same notes as a CMaj13#11 chord.
So, then these are the scales that you would use to improvise over these chords.

 <p>A 13th Chord is it’s own diatonic scale. This means that chords NOT extended all the way out to the 13th are slightly ambiguous because they are missing a few chord (and therefore scale) notes. And the key that they are in depends on the previous and subsequent chords in the progression. For this reason it is possible to play multiple scales over the same chord (if the chord is not a 13th chord). For example:
 Because a CMaj7 chord (C E G B) does NOT have an F in it, you can use the following two scales to improvise over it:   C Ionian (C D E F G A B); or
 C Lydian (C D E F# G A B).</p>
<p>Both scales contain all the notes that comprise the CMaj7 chord. Because the CMaj7 does not have a 9th, 11th or 13th we do not know what key it is in, and therefore we can use both scales over this chord. When thinking in terms of keys (rather than modes) we can say that the CMaj7 chord can be derived from both the key of C Major and G Major (C Lydian).</p>

<p>Looking at the whole chord progression, the CMaj7 chord is preceded by a G7 chord, so its reasonable to assume that the CMaj7 chord is in the key of C Major (rather than G Major). That doesn’t mean that we cannot use the C Lydian mode over the CMaj7 chord. The Chord-Scale System looks at individual chords in isolation and allocates scales to each individual chord. We do NOT need to know what key a particular chord is in, in order to choose a scale to play over that chord. In the above example, it doesn’t matter what key the CMaj7 chord is in, we can use both scales to improvise over it.
It’s often preferable to choose the scale outside the key of the chord progression in order to give a more harmonically complex and jazzy sound. If we had the chord progression: | G7 | CMaj7 ||
Many Jazz musicians would use the C Lydian mode over the CMaj7 chord precisely because the chord progression is NOT in the key of C Lydian (G Major).</p>

<p>Similarly: You could use the following scales over a Cm7 chord:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> C Dorian (C D E♭ F G A B♭);</li>
    <li> C Aeolian (C D E♭ F G A♭ B♭).</li>
    </ol>
<p>You could use the following scales over a C7 chord:</p>
<ol>
  <li> C Mixolydian (C D E F G A B♭);</li>
  <li>  C Lydian Dominant (C D E F# G A B♭).</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Chords and scales are both consist of the same limited number of notes. All music theory can be broken down into notes and intervals and things like scales and chords are just abstractions from the 12 notes of the octave.
