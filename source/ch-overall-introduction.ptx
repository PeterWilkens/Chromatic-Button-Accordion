  <introduction>

    <p>This Manual describes the C System Chromatic Button Accordion with both Stradella and Free Bass.</p>
    <p>The manual will focus primarily on chord and scale construction on both treble and free bass keyboards. </p>
    <p>I was drawn to the button accordion, rather than the piano accordion, noting that Chord and Scale construction on this type of keyboard allow the use of moveable shapes specific to different Chord and Scale Types. Each shape may be moved anywhere on the keyboard giving a chord or scale identified by the Tonic in the shape.</p> 

    <p>This use of keyboard shapes is similar to the way in which different Chords and Scales are represented  in many resources used by Guitar Players; removing the need to read music whilst still being able to learn about Scale and Chord construction. </p>
    <p>The shapes shown for the treble keyboard are mirrored on the free-bass keyboard so it is easy to generate the chord shapes for the bass once you have grasped how the  the treble side works.</p>
    <p>As a matter of interest, on the button accordion, chord shapes are consistent across the keyboard, unlike on the guitar where the interval between strings alters between the third and second string which necessitates some alteration of chord shapes in that area of the fingerboard.</p>
    <p> The main scales and chord types (in various inversions) will be considered. </p>.  
    <p> The Manual is written for accordions using a C System keyboard, but the B System layout is summarised in an Appendix.</p>
