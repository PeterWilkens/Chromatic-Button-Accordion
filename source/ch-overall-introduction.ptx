  <introduction>

    <p>This Manual describes the C System Chromatic Button Accordion with both Stradella and Free Bass.</p>
    <p>The manual will focus primarily on chord and scale construction on both treble and free bass keyboards. </p>
    <p>I was drawn to the button accordion, rather than the piano accordion, noting that Chord and Scale construction on this type of keyboard allow the use of moveable shapes specific to different Chord and Scale Types. That shape may be moved anywhere on the keyboard giving a chord or scale identified by the Tonic in the shape.</p> 

    <p>This use of keyboard shapes is similar to the way in which different Chords and Scales are represented  in many resources used by Guitar Players; removing the need to read music whilst still being able to learn about Scale and Chord construction. </p> <p> The main scales and chord types (in various inversions) will be considered. </p>
<p> The Manual is written for accordions using a C System keyboard, but the B System layout is summarised in an Appendix.</p>
