  <introduction>

    <p>This Manual describes the C System Chromatic Button Accordion with both Stradella and Free Bass.</p>
    <p> The intention is to present information and guidance, where applicable to the accordion, that has influenced me  during many years of playing finger-style guitar.</p>
    <p>I was particularly drawn to the button accordion (rather than the piano accordion); noting that Chord and Scale construction on this type of keyboard allow the use of moveable shapes specific to different Chord and Scale Types. That shape may be moved anywhere on the keyboard giving a chord identified by the Tonic in that shape.</p> 

    <p>This use of fingering shapes is similar to the way in which different Chords and Scales are represented  in many resources used by Guitar Players, removing the need to read music whilst still being able to learn about Scale and Chord construction and gaining access to the many Chord Progressions. A relatively small number of shapes cover all Scale  Chord Types in all inversions.</p>
