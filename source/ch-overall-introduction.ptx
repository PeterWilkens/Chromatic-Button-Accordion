  <introduction>
    <p>This is not an Accordion Tutor but covers material that I have found useful in learning about the Accordion after many years of playing the Guitar.</p>
    <p>Where I have covered a topic I have attempted to include as much information as is needed to assist someone new to the Accordion and without Music Theory knowledge to understand the topic.</p>
    <p> The Manual is written for the C System Chromatic Button Accordion with both Stradella and Free Bass.</p>
  
    <p>The Manual will focus primarily on Chord and Scale construction on both Treble and Free Bass keyboards. </p>
    <p>I was drawn to the button accordion, rather than the piano accordion, noting that Chord and Scale construction on this type of keyboard allow the use of moveable shapes specific to different Chord and Scale Types. Each shape may be moved anywhere on the keyboard giving a chord or scale identified by the Tonic in the shape.</p> 
    <p>Thus knowledge of any single shape enables the player to generate the chord type represented by that shape all over the keyboard in all  keys.</p>

    <p>This use of keyboard shapes is similar to the way in which different Chords and Scales are represented  in many resources used by Guitar Players; removing the need to read music whilst still being able to learn about Scale and Chord construction. </p>
    <p>The shapes shown for the treble keyboard are mirrored on the free-bass keyboard so it is easy to generate the chord shapes for the bass once you have grasped how the  the treble side works.</p>
    <p>As a matter of interest, on the button accordion, chord shapes are consistent across the keyboard, unlike on the guitar where the interval between strings alters between the third and second string which necessitates some alteration of chord shapes in that area of the fingerboard.</p>
    <p> The main scales and chord types (in various inversions) will be considered. </p> 
    <p>Another interesting feature of this type of accordion, is that on the treble and freebass keyboard, the consecutive rows on each keyboard are separated harmonically by a minor third. Thus any three adjacent vertical keys (that is in any of the five vertical columns) form a Diminished Triad, while any adjacent four notes form a Diminished 7th Chord. This can be particularly helpful if investigating the harmonic thinking of Barry Harris, who was a very influential jazz pianist and pedagogue. I cover some of this in the Chapter on the Diminished 6th Scale (so called by Barry Harris) but there is a lot more information on this and many videos of Barry Harris teaching on "You Tube".</p>
    <p>The Stradella bass keyboard is laid out such that consecutive vertical notes are arranged a fifth apart, making knowledge of the Circle of Fifths useful. See Chapter "The Circle of Fifths".</p>
