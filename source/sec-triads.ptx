  <title>Triads and their Inversions</title>
  <p>Intervals of a Third  are at the core of chord construction and Triads are made by stacking the third and fifth note of a scale on top of the Root note. In the C Major Scale, the third interval above C is E and the third interval above E is G. The C Major Triad is thus CEG.</p>
  <p>It should also be noted that a Major Triad consists of a Minor Third stacked on top of a Major Third when in the Root position ie; in the case of C Major the Minor Third E to G is stacked on top of the Major Third C to E.</p>
  <p>A C Minor Triad is produced in the same fashion by stacking the Third of the C Minor Scale on top of the Root with the Fifth stacked on top of the third, but in the case of the C Minor scale the Third is E <flat/> and not E, thus the Minor Triad becomes C-E<flat/>-G demonstrating that a Minor Triad consists of a Major Third Stacked on top of a Minor Third when in the Root Position. </p>
  <p>All Triads can be played as Inversions when the order of the notes are changed. eg; 1st Inversion: 3rd, 5th, Root and 2nd Inversion Fifth, Root and 3rd.</p>
  <p> The other main Triads are: The Diminished Triad and The Augmented Triad. They are combinations of dissimilar thirds. ie; the Diminished Triad is constructed from a minor third built onto a minor third and an Augmented Triad is constructed from a major third built onto a major third. Diagram 6.1.2 above shows the shape of each Chord. The Tonic note 1 gives the identity ie; if note 1 is D the Triad is a D Chord. Minor, Diminished or Augmented dependant on shape</p>
